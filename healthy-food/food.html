            <h3 class="nabil" id="Health">Health education can be defined as the principle by which individuals and
                groups of people
                learn to
                behave in a manner conducive to the promotion, maintenance, or restoration of health. However, as there
                are multiple definitions of health, there are also multiple definitions of health education. In the
                U.S., the Joint Committee on Health Education and Promotion Terminology of 2001 defined Health Education
                as "any combination of planned learning experiences based on sound theories that provide individuals,
                groups, and communities the opportunity to acquire information and the skills needed to make quality
                health decisions."[4]

                The World Health Organization <a href="https://www.who.int/">(WHO)</a> defined Health Education as
                consisting of "consciously constructed opportunities for learning involving some form of communication
                designed to improve health literacy, including improving knowledge, and developing life skills which are
                conducive to individual and community health.</h3>
